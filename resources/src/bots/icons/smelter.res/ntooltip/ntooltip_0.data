#text
This is an ore smelting bot. This is an automatic bot that can be run by the scheduler. You need to specify the area with ore, fuel (coal or blocks - depending on the type of smelter found), as well as the area where bars are stored. Can work with the Ingredients system. You will also need a way to ignite smelter (candelabrum or branches). Optionally, you can specify a area with a barrel for storing mercury (in this case, you need an empty bucket in your hands). You can also specify the parameters for saving the slag (in the client settings)
